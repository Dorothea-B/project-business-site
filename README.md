# Guitar lessons - Business Site

The assignment was to create a business site containing a video header, javascript accordion and form.

## The problem

I made a fairly basic solution starting off with the mobile first version. 
The page is still not behaving exactly like I want it to on mobile devices, but I've placed a fallback image incase the video doesn't load.

If I had more time I would've added arrows to the accordion that animates when opening/closing the sections.
